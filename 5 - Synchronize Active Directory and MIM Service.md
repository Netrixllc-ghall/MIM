# Create the MIM management agent
The MIM management agent (MA) is a connector for MIM Sync to the MIM Service. To create this connector, you use the Create Management Agent wizard.
When you configure a MIM management agent, you need to specify a user account. This document uses MIMMA as the name for this account.

 Note

The account you use for your MIM management agent must be the same account as the one you have specified during the installation of MIM Service. If you plan to enable 'Use MIMSync account' feature then MIM Synchronization Service must be installed using Group Managed Service Account.

# There are four steps you need to take before you can test your MIM configuration with AD data:
## Enable Provisioning
### Open the Synchronization Service Manager.
- To open the Options dialog box, on the Tools menu, click Options
- Select Enable Synchronization Rule Provisioning.
- To close the Options dialog box, click OK.
# Initialize the MIMMA
- Run a complete synchronization cycle on this connector. The complete cycle consists of the following run profiles:
```
Full Import
Full Synchronization
Export
Delta Import
```
# Follow these steps to run each of the four run profiles.
- Open the Synchronization Service Manager and, on the Tools menu, click Management Agents.
- In the Management Agents list, select MIMMA.
- To open the Run Management Agent dialog box, on the Actions menu, click Run.
- For each run profile listed above, complete the following steps:
- To open the Run Management Agent dialog box, on the Actions menu, click Run.
- In the Run profiles list, select the run profile you want to run.
- To start the run profile, click OK.

# Configure attribute flow precedence
During the initialization of the MIM connector, the configured synchronization rules were brought into the metaverse.
Adjust the attribute flow precedence for the attributes contributed by this connector to ensure that attributes already in AD can flow into the metaverse and later also into the MIM Service database.
# Initialize the ADMA
## To initialize the Active Directory connector, you need to run a full import and a full synchronization on it. The full import brings the existing objects from AD into the connector space. The full synchronization updates the synchronization rules to match those of the MIM connector.
- Open the Synchronization Service Manager and in the Tools menu, click Management Agents.
- In the Management Agents list, select ADMA.
- To open the Run Management Agent dialog box, on the Actions menu, click Run.
- For each run profile listed above, complete the following steps:
- To open the Run Management Agent dialog box, on the Actions menu, click Run.
- In the Run profiles list, select the run profile you want to run.
- To start the run profile, click OK.
# Populate the MIM Service database
## To populate the MIM Service database with the objects, you need to run a synchronization cycle on the MIMMA connector. The cycle consists of:
```
Export
Full Import
Full Synchronization
```
## Follow these steps to run each of the three run profiles.
- Open the Synchronization Service Manager and click Management Agents on the Tools menu.
- Select MIMMA in the Management Agents list.
- Click Run on the Actions menu to open the Run Management Agent dialog box.
## For each run profile listed above, complete the following steps:
Click Run on the Actions menu to open the Run Management Agent dialog box.
Select the run profile you want to run from the Run profiles list.
Click OK to start the run profile.
